# gbg-assessment-web

AngularJS Web application assessment for GBG Job Application

## Installation

This project requires [Bower](http://bower.io) to install the required libraries and frameworks.
In order to run the application you'll need to have a local web server. [Live-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), a light-weight NodeJS http server
 will do the trick. After making sure Bower and Live-Server are installed:
 
 ```
     $ git clone https://github.com/jvnicholson/gbg-assessment-web.git
     $ cd gbg-assessment-web
     $ bower install
     $ live-server
 ```
